                <img src="images\olobor.jpeg" alt="olobor">
                <p>Olobor, leader of the Black Rock coalition and one of the most photographed lions of the Maasai Mara,
                    was celebrated for his golden mane and commanding presence. A symbol of strength and leadership, he
                    played a central role in the dominance of his coalition across the reserve. His life was cut short
                    when he was killed in a human-wildlife conflict, reportedly speared by herders during a territorial
                    clash. Olobor‚Äôs death marked the loss of a legend, leaving behind a legacy that will be remembered
                    by wildlife lovers around the world.</p>

            <div>
                <img src="images\lorkulup.jpeg" alt="lorkulup">
                <p>Lorkulup was one of the most iconic lions of the Maasai Mara, famed for his strength, resilience, and
                    hunting prowess. Born in 2017, he had survived buffalo hunts, spear wounds, and even a venomous
                    snake bite.
                    His death was confirmed in early 2025 after rangers found his body beside an eland carcass.
                    The theory is that in the course of hunting the eland, Lorkulup got severely injured, which left him
                    vulnerable, and likely hyenas seized the opportunity to kill him.
                    Some controversy remains, because parts of the carcass were missing whiskers and claws, raising
                    questions among observers about whether human interference played a part.</p>

            <div>
                <img src="images\scarface.jpeg" alt="scarface">
                <p>Scarface was the most iconic lion of the Maasai Mara, instantly recognized by the deep scar across
                    his right eye that gave him both his name and his legendary look. As part of the famous four-brother
                    coalition, he helped rule over vast prides and territories, embodying strength, dominance, and
                    resilience. Despite countless battles and injuries, he lived to an extraordinary age for a wild
                    lion, passing away peacefully in 2021 at around 14 years old. Scarface‚Äôs legacy as the ‚ÄúLion King of
                    the Mara‚Äù endures, making him one of the most celebrated lions in the world.</p>

                <img src="images\jesse.jpeg" alt="jesse">
                <p>Jesse was a unique and beloved figure in the Maasai Mara, known for his solitary lifestyle and
                    wandering spirit. Unlike many males who fought to control prides, Jesse spent most of his life as a
                    nomad, moving through different territories and surviving on his own. His independence and
                    resilience earned him admiration from those who followed his story, showing that strength in the
                    wild comes in many forms. Though he never ruled a pride, Jesse‚Äôs journey as a lone lion made him
                    just as legendary, leaving behind a legacy of freedom and survival.</p>
